The goal of this project is to analyze a wine quality dataset and build a predictive model that can accurately classify the quality of wines based on various physicochemical characteristics. We will explore different machine learning algorithms and compare their performance to determine the most effective model for predicting wine quality
objectives :
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset, identify any missing values, and visualize the relationships between variables.
Preprocess the data, including handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables if necessary.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the models.
Train and evaluate different machine learning algorithms for predicting wine quality, such as:
Logistic Regression , Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Optimize the hyperparameters of each algorithm using techniques like grid search or random search to improve their performance.
Compare the performance of the trained models using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Select the best performing model and provide insights into the most important features influencing wine quality.
In this project, we successfully analyzed the wine quality dataset and built several predictive models to classify wine quality based on its physicochemical properties. After thorough exploration and evaluation of various machine learning algorithms, we arrived at the following key conclusions:
Model Performance: Among the algorithms tested, Random Forest emerged as the best-performing model, achieving the highest accuracy and F1-score. Its ability to handle non-linear relationships and interactions between features contributed significantly to its performance.
conclusion : This wine quality prediction project employed diverse machine learning algorithms, with Random Forest with (98 percent) accuracy emerging as the top performer. Key factors like alcohol and volatile acidity were identified as critical determinants of quality. The insights gained demonstrate the value of machine learning in the wine industry and motivate future research to refine models and expand understanding.
